Teacher teached us that the interface `List` is an example of the application of the `strategy` design pattern.


## Implementations

Please see the implementations in the `src` directory.


### Singleton

Teacher showed us three similar variations of `Singleton` implementations. To more details, please see [this class](https://web.dio.me/lab/explorando-padroes-de-projetos-na-pratica-com-java/learning/fed94247-3cf7-4b04-a9b2-ead7bfd1c51a).

If you need to understand better this pattern, please watch [the class](https://web.dio.me/lab/explorando-padroes-de-projetos-na-pratica-com-java/learning/b85aef03-dad2-4e21-bbbf-e40aa02a9519?back=/track/coding-the-future-claro-java-spring-boot) and see the examples in the `src` folder.
